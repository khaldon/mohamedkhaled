## Where Ideas Become Reality

Hi, I'm **Mohamed Khaled**, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about Natural Language Processing and cutting-edge AI technologies. I bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning and production-ready systems.

### My Expertise

- **Natural Language Processing**: Transformer architectures, text processing, prompt engineering
- **Large Language Models**: Fine-tuning and deploying LLMs for specific applications
- **ML Engineering**: End-to-end model training, optimization, and MLOps
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building web applications with integrated ML capabilities

### Professional Journey

As a **Machine Learning Engineer** with 1+ years specializing in NLP/LLMs and several years in web development, I've:

- Engineered Python APIs processing 1,000+ daily invoices for ERP systems
- Architected data transformation pipelines reducing manual processing by 60%
- Developed text classification systems using Hugging Face transformers
- Built web applications with integrated NLP capabilities
- Deployed ML models as scalable microservices

Previously at **Monzer Foda Co. Ltd** and the **Egyptian E-Invoicing System**, I combined technical skills with problem-solving to create efficient, production-ready solutions.
